### Legal Context of 'Conflict Minerals'
The United States only regulates the 3TGs (tin, tantalum, tungsten, and gold) that originate in the Congo and surrounding countries (Global Witness). Passed as part of the Dodd Frank Act, section 1502 requires companies to check and  report on their supply chains to the US. This law does not require companies to report on their supply chains that originated in other parts of the world.

Global Witness. “Section 1502 of the US Dodd Frank Act: Global Witness.” Global Witness, www.globalwitness.org/en/campaigns/conflict-minerals/dodd-frank-act-section-1502/.

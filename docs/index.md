# Tin Overview
- - - -
Tin is a widely-used metal with a variety of applications. Tin's most pervasive use case is as a component of solder, which is used to join electronic components. Recent increases in production of consumer electronics has lead to increased extraction and refinement of tin, but most tin mining operations pose major risks to human and environmental health and can lead to geopolitical conflict.

### Legal Context of 'Conflict Minerals'
The United States only regulates the 3TGs (tin, tantalum, tungsten, and gold) that originate in the Congo and surrounding countries (Global Witness). Passed as part of the Dodd Frank Act, section 1502 requires companies to check and  report on their supply chains to the US. This law does not require companies to report on their supply chains that originated in other parts of the world.

=======
To address some of these concerns, the United States Dodd Frank act (passed in 2010) included provisions to regulate the 'conflict metals' (tin, tantalum, tungsten, and gold) as armed groups in the Democratic Republic of the Congo were their production to finance ongoing regional conflict. 

While regulating mining in the DRC is important, these laws fail to recognize the injustices inherent to tin mining elsewhere. After all, the DRC produces a very small fraction of tin produced worldwide while nations in Southeast Asia and China produce a majority of tin with very little regulation. Legal frameworks (and corporate supply chains) ought to recognize the environmental and human costs of tin mining in every region, especially those that ultimately produce the most tin.

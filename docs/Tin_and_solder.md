# The crazy world of Solder

## Solder Overview
The most common use case for Tin is solder. Solder is used in everything electronic, itâ€™s how circuit components are stuck to both each other and the board. Aside from circuitry, solder is often used in pipes, welding, sheet metal, making stained glass, etc [1]. The great part about solder is that it can be melted, and flexibly moved, but once it is dried, the bonds it forms are strong.

Initially, solder had a strong lead core. Usually in ratios of between 65-50 parts tin, and the remaining parts lead [1]. However, after the health risks of lead were discovered, the industry switched over to using mostly lead-free solder. Lead-free solder is usually made of one of two alloys: SnAgCu and SnCu [2]. The debate over lead-free versus lead-in solder is ongoing. Some argue that lead-in solder works better, but the health arguments are hard to ignore. Below is a table summarizing the health risks of using each:

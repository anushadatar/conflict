# Tin and Solder
## Solder Overview
A common use case for tin is solder. Solder is used in almost every electronic product, as it is how circuit components are physically and electrically connected to both each other and the circuit board. Aside from circuitry, solder is often used in pipes, welding, sheet metal, making stained glass, etc. (Siviour et. al). Solder is useful in that it can be melted and flexibly moved, but once it is dried, the bonds it forms are strong.

Initial versions of solder had a strong lead core in ratios of between 65-50 parts tin and the remaining parts lead (Winston). However, after the health risks of lead were discovered and publicized, the industry switched over to using mostly lead-free solder. Lead-free solder is usually made using alloys of tin with elements such as silver (Ag) and copper (Cu) (Pang). 

The debate between lead-free and leaded solder is ongoing. Some argue that leaded solder works better: leaded solder heats up at a lower temperature than lead-free solder, is cheaper than lead-free solder, and dries shiny, which makes it easier to spot oxidation issues (Li et. al). However, the health risks of leaded solder are hard to ignore. 

## Leaded Solder
### Chemical and Thermal Properties
In the past, lead-based solder was industry standard for plumbing and electrical applications. Greater understanding of the risk associated with lead products has caused this type of solder to be phased out. Lead-based solder has been prohibited in joints for plumbing systems since the 1980s. In 2006, the European Union functionally prohibited the use of lead-based solder in consumer electronics (Pang).

The most common forms of lead-based solder are 60-40 and 50-50 tin-lead mixtures. The 60-40 composition is close to the eutectic composition of tin and lead, so the substance has a low melting point and has a narrow range in which it melts and solidifies. This makes it well suited for electrical work (FCT). 50-50 tin-lead solder can melt and freeze over a larger range of temperatures.  It freezes around 220°C and solidifies at 183°C. This means the mixture is workable for a longer period of time which makes it useful for plumbing applications (Winston).

The phase diagram indicates that at ~63% tin and ~37% lead composition the mixture freezes and melts at 183 °C. This type of solder, when used in electrical applications, melts beginning at 183°C and is fully liquid at 191°C.  When the liquid solder is cooling and crosses the eutectic point two solids are formed (a Pb solid and a Sn solid) (FCT).

In the SEM micrograph of a SnPb solder joint, the alternating layers of solid are indicative of a eutectic composition in solid form. Those layers are distributed by atomic diffusion and the dark regions are rich in tin, while the light regions are rich in lead.

### Sustainability and Impacts
Lead-based solder has both an environmental impact as well as a human-health risk.  Soldering produces fine particles of solder that can be inhaled or accidentally ingested by individuals soldering.  Lead based plumbing systems can introduce lead into a building water source and have particularly serious health consequences for children.  In electrical applications, lead in e-waste can leach into groundwater and soil. Exposure to lead has been linked to occupational cancer, occupational diseases, public health problems (like damage to air and water quality), and chronic non-cancer diseases (Almedia et. al).

## Lead Free Solder
### Chemical and Thermal Properties
There are several notable lead-free solder compounds that combine tin with other metals such as silver (Ag), copper (Cu), zinc (Zn), bismuth (Bi), indium (In), and antimony (Sb). One common alloy is Sn-Ag, or Tin and Silver, which has the following phase diagram (Chen).

The phase diagram indicates that tin and silver form a eutectic solid at 220.9 °C and 3.87% Ag - at this point, the solution will be a liquid. While this point is higher than the melting point of tin-lead solders, it is still within range for most manufacturing processes. The solid that forms right below the melting point at 3.5% Ag has the following microstructure depending on the cooling rate - the image labeled S040 cooled at -6.6 °C/second, the image labeled S120 cooled at -2.0 °C/second, and the image labeled S200 cooled at -0.3 °C/second. Faster cooling leads to a finer structure with smaller grain sizes of dendritic tin, while slower cooling leads to plate-like microstructures and larger grain sizes (Hurtony).

### Sustainability and Impacts
Lead-free solder is significantly less toxic to the environment than leaded solder is. One of the most notable damages caused by the disposal of printed circuit boards is lead leaching, so eliminating leaded solder from printed circuit boards mitigates that effect (Park). That being said, the production and disposal of tin and the replacement alloy has associated overhead as well that cannot be disregarded just because lead is far worse. After all, lead-free solder contains more tin than leaded solder, and current tin mining operations pose risks both to human and environmental health.

## Conclusion
The chemical properties and use cases of both leaded and unleaded solder has significant impacts both on electronic products themselves and the human lives and systems impacted by their production, use, and disposal. While lead-free solder has less drastic environmental impacts on the sink side, lead-free solder still has negative impacts on human and environmental health, especially on the sourse side.

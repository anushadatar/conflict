# Tin Mining in Southeast Asia and China

About 75% of the world's tin production and mining occurs in the Southeast Asia Tin Belt and China (Schwartz). The Southeast Asia Tin Belt is a north-south elongate zone 2800 km long and 400 km wide, extending from Burma (Myanmar) and Thailand to Peninsular Malaysia and the Indonesian Tin Islands" (Schwartz). Below is a map of the Southeast Asian Tin Belt:

Within the Southeast Asia belt, the largest producers are Indonesia and Myanmar. Within these three largest producers, there is a fair amount of illegal trade, particularly to mined tin from Myanmar to China to be fully processed. THe vast majority of the tin imported by China comes through this trade. Despite the vast majority of Tin mining happening in this general region, we rarely hear about Tin mining anywere except for the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Presumeably, this is because much of the Congo's mining industry is corrupt and unregulation. However, the same is true in Southeast Asia and China, where much more Tin is produced, but corruption, lack-of-safety equiptment and regulated, and militia-run mines are still popular.
